# Neural-Network-Java
This is a feedforward neural network coded in Java from scratch, without using any external JARs or dependencies. It performs sentiment analysis on tweets i.e. classifying them as either positive or negative. Feel free to fork it, and modify it according to your requirements, but do give credit :)
